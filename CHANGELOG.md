# CHANGELOG

## 2.1.0
- In case a property is an object create a new instance of that object instead of using a POJO (https://github.com/derbenoo/ts-configurable/issues/37)
-

## 2.0.1
- Fix a bug where non-ciphertext string values where set to null with setNullOnDecryptionFailure=true

## 2.0.0
- Breaking changes: options object for decryption changed: from `decryptionSecrets` to `decryption`: `secrets`, `setNullOnDecryptionFailure`
- Implement setNullOnDecryptionFailure flag

## 1.0.0

- Breaking changes: values are base64 encoded before being encrypted and base64 decoded after being decrypted. This way, when providing multiple keys, a correct decryption can be determined by checking whether the plaintext only contains charactesr from the base64 characterset.
- Export the `decrypt` method from the package so the consumer can test the correct functionality of encryption and decryption.

## 0.3.1

- Fixed error during packaging/ publishing which made the package unusable.

## 0.2.0
